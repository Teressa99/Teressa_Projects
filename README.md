## About me
Hi there! I'm Teressa Dominic, and welcome to my Data Analysis portfolio.

With a strong foundation in digital marketing and financial data analysis, I specialize in uncovering insights from complex datasets and transforming them into clear, compelling visual stories. My passion lies in using data to drive informed decisions.

This portfolio highlights my technical skills across tools such as Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI, and PowerPoint, along with my ability to communicate findings effectively. Whether it's cleaning messy data, building dashboards, or performing deep-dive analyses, I'm always excited to learn and explore new ways data can make an impact.

## Portfolio Projects

### 1.Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection Using Deep Learning  
**Description:** This project proposes a deep learning solution for early detection of intracranial hemorrhage, a time-sensitive medical emergency. Using CT scan image data, two supervised learning models were developed:  
- A transfer learning approach using **AlexNet**, and  
- A **custom CNN architecture**.  
The goal was to accurately classify CT scans into hemorrhage types for faster diagnosis and treatment support.

- **Tools & Technologies:** Python, CNN, Transfer Learning, AlexNet, Computer Vision, Medical Imaging
