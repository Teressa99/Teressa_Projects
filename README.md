## About me
Hi there! I'm Teressa Dominic, and welcome to my Data Analysis portfolio.

With a strong foundation in digital marketing and financial data analysis, I specialize in uncovering insights from complex datasets and transforming them into clear, compelling visual stories. My passion lies in using data to drive informed decisions.

This portfolio highlights my technical skills across tools such as Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI, and PowerPoint, along with my ability to communicate findings effectively. Whether it's cleaning messy data, building dashboards, or performing deep-dive analyses, I'm always excited to learn and explore new ways data can make an impact.
